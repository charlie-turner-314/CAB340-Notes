[[Lecture 1]]
**Cryptography**
Hidden writing. Turning messages into unintelligible
Protected writing
**Cryptanalysis**
Studying weakness in cryptography
**Plaintext (P)** - Information to be protected
**Ciphertext (C)** - Garbled message
**Encryption (E)** - The process to take P to C
**Decryption (D)** - The process to recover P from C
**Cryptographic Key (K)** - The special input of algorithms to unlock their operation

**Modular Inverse**
The modular inverse of $a$ is $a^{-1}$, and exists if $a\cdot a^{-1}\equiv 1 (\mod n)$ 
Only numbers that are coprime to $n$ have modular inverses, e.g $g.c.d (a, n) = 1$
