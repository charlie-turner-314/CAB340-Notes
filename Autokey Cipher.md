Aperiodic
A varient of the [[Vigenere Cipher]]
- Uses a similar d-letter key
- Works on the first d letters
- After d letters, use the plaintext as the next letters of the key
**Advantage**: Key theoretically never reused
**Disadvantage**: Key still only really d letters long, if the plaintext is autocorrellated, so is the key?
